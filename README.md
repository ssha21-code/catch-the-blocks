# catch-the-blocks
This is a program made in Raylib C++. It is a small, fun game made in C++.
This game is about catching the green circles known as Collectibles using a white rectangle known as a Collector.
The spawn rate of Collectibles increase when the score gets higher and higher.
Shooting the red Collectibles has a 25% chance to earn you a point.
The Collectibles spawn every two seconds and in each turn, there is a chance of a special yellow Collectible.
If you catch this collectible, it will give you either a speed boost, or immunity from red Collectibles.
The goal is to catch as many green Collectibles as possible, and shoot down the red Collectibles.
